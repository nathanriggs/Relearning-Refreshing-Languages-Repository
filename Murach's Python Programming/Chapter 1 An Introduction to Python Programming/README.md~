# Relearning-Refreshing-Languages-Repository

This is simply a place where I'll be putting all of the practices I do from books I'm using to relearn or refresh my memory on different languages. These won't be direct copies from the books' sources provided on their websites, so if you want to see those, go to the appropriate website for the book.
